CUnit is now installed for EE & IOP in \$PS2DEV/ee and \$PS2DEV/iop

EE instructions:
  Compiling against and running the EE version follows the same procedure as
  any other CUnit test program - no special steps are required beyond the
  normal for compiling a PS2 program (i.e.  using ee-gcc) and adding -lcunit to
  your link.

IOP instructions:
  Please see the README for ps2-cunit-port for information on how to compile
  and run a test program for the IOP.
  The tl;dr is that there's a fair few imports needed
  (see iop-test/iop-imports.c), and if running via ps2link the alloc.irx from
  \$PS2SDK/iop/irx needs to be loaded first, like in the following:

      cd \$PS2SDK/iop/irx
      ps2client execiop host:alloc.irx

  Please feel free to open an issue at github.com/telyn/ps2-cunit-port if you
  can't get it running. Pull requests are welcome too :-)
