# Before usage, please be certain that your ps2client-tagged runners all have
# `limit = 1` set in their config.toml. Having a non-1 limit set for ps2client
# runners will likely result in your PS2 being power-cycled mid-test, breaking
# your builds.
# Please see the README available at https://gitlab.com/telyn/ps2runner for more
# information on configuring a gitlab-runner for ps2runner
